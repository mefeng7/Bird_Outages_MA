# Bird_Outages_MA
This contains the data and analysis for a study of animal-related outages in the state of Massachusetts from 2013-2018.
All data formating and analysis took place in R version 4.0.3. 
The original outage data comes from Eversource Energy, National Grid, and Unitil Corporation, made available through the MA office of Energy and Environmental Affairs. The outage dataset used in this analysis is available on Columbia University's International Research Institute (IRI) for Climate and Society Data Library at http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.EOEEA/.
The original bird abundance data comes from the eBird Basic Dataset (May 2020) and the modeled relative abundance estimates for Massachusetts towns are also available on the IRI Data Library at http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.PRISM/.eBird/.derived/.detectionProbability/.
